**Impact of Urbanization and Income Levels on Global Migration Patterns: A Statistical Analysis Using UN International Migrant Stock (1990â€“2024) and HDI Trends**

Project Overview
This project investigates how urbanization and income levels influence global migration patterns between 1990 and 2024.
By integrating data from the United Nations (UN DESA), World Bank, and UNDP Human Development Reports, this study aims to uncover relationships between migration trends, socioeconomic development, and urban growth.



Datasets Used
1. UN DESA International Migrant Stock (1990â€“2024)
   - Source: [UN Data Portal](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/undesa_pd_2024_ims_stock_by_sex_destination_and_origin.xlsx)  
   - Data on migrant stock by destination/origin and year.

2. World Bank Development Indicators
   - Source: [World Bank API](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?downloadformat=csv)  
   - Includes GDP per capita and urban population (%).

3. UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) Trends (1990â€“2023)
   - Source: [UNDP HDR 2025 Statistical Annex â€“ HDI Trends](https://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2025_HDR/HDR25_Statistical_Annex_HDI_Trends_Table.xlsx)  


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Descriptive statistics and visualizations using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.  
   - Global and regional migration trend plots (1990â€“2024).  
   - Correlation heatmaps for migration vs. development indicators.  
   - Scatter plots for HDI, GDP, and urbanization relationships with migration.

Statistical & Machine Learning Models (Next)
   - Regression Analysis:** Multiple and panel regression to assess impacts on migration stock.  
   - Clustering:** K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group countries with similar migration-development profiles.
